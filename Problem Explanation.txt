Sure! In this problem, Chef is given two permutation arrays: `A` and `P`, each of length `N`. A permutation array is an array containing `N` distinct integers from 1 to `N` in arbitrary order.

Chef performs three types of operations on array `A`:

1. Type 1: Permute the array `A` according to the order defined by permutation `P`. In this operation, each element in `A` is replaced by the corresponding element in `A` as per the indices defined by `P`. For example, if `P` is [2, 3, 1] and `A` is [1, 2, 3], after the permutation operation, `A` will become [2, 3, 1].

2. Type 2: Swap the elements at positions `x` and `y` in array `A`. This operation swaps the elements at indices `x` and `y` in `A`.

3. Type 3: Output the element at position `x` in array `A`. This operation simply prints the element at index `x` in `A`.

For each test case, you need to perform the given operations on array `A` and output the elements as specified by the type 3 queries.

Let's take the provided sample input to understand the process:
```
1
3
1 2 3
2 3 1
3
1
2 2 3
3 1
```

- The first line `1` represents the number of test cases.
- In the first test case:
  - `N = 3` represents the length of the array.
  - `A = [1, 2, 3]` represents the initial array.
  - `P = [2, 3, 1]` represents the permutation array.
  - `Q = 3` represents the number of operations to be performed.
  - The following lines are the operations:
    - Type 1 operation: Permute `A` according to `P`. `A` becomes [2, 3, 1].
    - Type 2 operation: Swap elements at positions 2 and 3 in `A`. `A` becomes [2, 1, 3].
    - Type 3 operations: Output the elements at positions 1 and 3 in `A`. The output will be `3` followed by `2`.
